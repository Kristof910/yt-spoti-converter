Welcome!

This is a music playlist converter where you can insert a YouTube playlist of your choice to convert it to a Spotify playlist by a press of a button! The service will analyse all the videos you linked and find the matching songs on Spotify and will create a playlist on your Spotify account, feel free to use it and leave a feedback!

Please use the setup.py with your YouTube api key beforehand!

This is the back-end endpoint for the app, you will have to use the front-end service too, here is the link for that: https://github.com/Kristof910/yt-spoti-converter-front-end

Thank you!
